## Introduction
*Venture through different floors, fight in boss raids, and earn powerful weapons! This game has over 100 different weapons you can collect and has many bosses for you and your friends to fight!*

This project is an MMORPG/Fighting game where users will start off with generic weapons and no money, but as they continue playing the game, completing different worlds and boss fights, 
they will earn many treasures, such as stronger and rarer weapons and gold. 

* Over 18 unique boss fights that users can play against. Each boss has strengths and weaknesses, allowing strategies to be formed, tailoring to each user's experience.
* Over 100 unique weapons that users can earn and collect.
* Weapons that users get will get have randomly generated stats and abilities, allowing for unique and varying weapons to obtain.
* Many mechanics and features exist that allow users to augment and customize their character and items. Users can also trade items with others.
* Has a party system where users can team up and fight against bosses together.

From a technical viewpoint, the project features...
* A handful of algorithms for different features of the game, designed to maintain user retention and overall enjoyability. Many algorithms were planned, experimented, and applied to determine the most effective algorithms.
* A database that stores every single user's data, with a "migration" feature that allows for easy data recovery whenever a user is suspected to data corruption by fetching one of their older saved data.
* A system that is modular, designed in an object-oriented manner. This allows for many skills/abilities to be created very quickly and easy on the developing end while being very unique from another.
* User Interface with a minimalistic and modern theme.
